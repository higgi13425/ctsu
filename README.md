# ctsu
This shiny app allows the upload of a task_report.xlsx file and a protocol_summary.xlsx file, 
and subsequent reproducible data wrangling to produce a downloadable summary report in xlsx format for each CTSU.

Future goals include 
- customizing name of output file with the name of the CTSU
- currently only produces pre-award reports, future goal is
- 3 different reports (filter by rows) for 
  - pre-award
  - post-award
  - amendments
